"""WQSF (Water Quality Science Flags) quality / cloud masking.

Cloud-edge buffering
--------------------
After the per-pixel WQSF mask is built, the *cloud-class* portion of it
(``CLOUD``, ``CLOUD_AMBIGUOUS``, ``CLOUD_MARGIN``) is optionally dilated
spatially by ``MaskingConfig.dilation_px`` pixels. This catches sub-pixel
cloud edges and aerosol haloes that the per-pixel flags miss but that
visibly inflate chl_nn near mask boundaries. Only cloud-class flags are
dilated — buffering glint, snow/ice, or sensor flags (COSMETIC, SUSPECT,
SATURATED, INVALID) would discard good water unnecessarily, since those
flags don't have an "edge contamination" failure mode.

The WQSF layer in every OLCI L2 product is a per-pixel **bitfield**:
each bit indicates one quality condition (cloud, sun glint, saturation,
algorithm failure, ...). The masking step:

1. Reads the flag-name → bit-mask table from the WQSF variable's
   ``flag_meanings`` and ``flag_masks`` attributes (rather than
   hardcoding bit positions, since these can change between processing
   baselines).
2. OR-combines the bit masks for the flags the caller wants to reject.
3. Marks every pixel where ``wqsf & combined_bitmask != 0`` as bad.
4. Returns a boolean :class:`xarray.DataArray` (``True`` = masked / bad).

The mask is applied with :func:`apply_mask`, which sets bad pixels to
NaN. NaN propagates correctly through resampling and is naturally
ignored by ``nanmean`` compositing.

Why use product metadata instead of a static table
--------------------------------------------------
EUMETSAT recommends reading flag masks from the product itself because
the bit assignments are not formally guaranteed to be stable across
processing baselines. Reading from metadata makes the pipeline
forward-compatible with future reprocessings.

    Parameters
    ----------
    scene : satpy.Scene
        Scene that has been ``load()``-ed with ``"wqsf"`` available.
    masking_config : MaskingConfig
        Strictness preset (or custom flag list) to apply.
    product : str, optional
        Dataset name (``"chl_nn"``, ``"chl_oc4me"``, …). If given,
        product-aware flags (BAC processing-chain, per-product algorithm
        failure) are added on top of the common flags. If ``None``, only
        common flags are used.

    Returns
    -------
    xarray.DataArray
        Boolean mask with the same dims/coords as ``scene["wqsf"]``;
        ``True`` means "pixel is bad, mask it out".

    Notes
    -----
    Returns an all-``False`` mask (and warns) in two non-fatal cases:

    * the WQSF layer carries no ``flag_meanings`` / ``flag_masks``
      metadata at all;
    * none of the requested flag names match anything in the metadata.

    Both situations indicate something is wrong upstream, but masking
    nothing is more useful than failing the entire run.
